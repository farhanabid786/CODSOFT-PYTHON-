Hi! This  going to my first internship and I am very excited to perform all the given task in the python programming interniship .

**DETAILS/EXPLAINATION FOR PROJECT 1 **:-

TO DO LIST APPLICATIION can be useful in various filed of life by using it as Time Management , prioritization , Productivity , Remainder , Goal Setting , etc .

**steps for creation of the To do list Application :-**

Define an empty list: We start by defining an empty list called tasks to store our to-do items.

Show Menu: The show_menu function displays the options available to the user.

Add Task: The add_task function prompts the user to enter a task, which is then added to the tasks list.

View Tasks: The view_tasks function displays all the tasks in the list. If the list is empty, it informs the user.

Remove Task: The remove_task function first displays the tasks, then prompts the user to enter the number of the task they want to remove. It removes the task if the number is valid.

Main Program Loop: The while loop keeps the program running, displaying the menu and executing the chosen option until the user decides to exit by selecting option '4'.
