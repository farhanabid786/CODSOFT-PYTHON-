# CODSOFT-PYTHON-
Hi! This  going to my first internship and I am very excited to perform all the given task in the python programming interniship .

**DETAILS/EXPLAINATION FOR PROJECT 1**:-

TO DO LIST APPLICATIION can be useful in various filed of life by using it as Time Management , prioritization , Productivity , Remainder , Goal Setting , etc .

**steps for creation of the To do list Application :-**

**Define an empty list**: We start by defining an empty list called tasks to store our to-do items.

**Show Menu**: The show_menu function displays the options available to the user.

**Add Task**: The add_task function prompts the user to enter a task, which is then added to the tasks list.

**View Tasks**: The view_tasks function displays all the tasks in the list. If the list is empty, it informs the user.

**Remove Task:** The remove_task function first displays the tasks, then prompts the user to enter the number of the task they want to remove. It removes the task if the number is valid.

**Main Program Loop**: The while loop keeps the program running, displaying the menu and executing the chosen option until the user decides to exit by selecting option '4'.

**Details/Explainations for Project 2 (Simple Calculator)**

A simple calculator program in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**steps for creation of the simple calculator :-**

Define the following Functions given below :

**add(x, y)**: Returns the sum of x and y.

**subtract(x, y)**: Returns the difference between x and y.

**multiply(x, y)**: Returns the product of x and y.

**divide(x, y)**: Returns the quotient of x and y, with a check to prevent division by zero.

Now create the **Main Program Loop** :

Displays a menu with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exit.

Prompts the user to enter their choice,i.e., enter variable.

If the enter is valid, it asks for two numbers and performs the corresponding operation.

If the enter is '5', it exits the program.

If the input is invalid, it prompts the user to enter a valid choice.

**Details/Explaination for the project3 ( Password Generator)** :-

A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password .

**steps for creation of the Password Generator tool :-**

firstly , **Import Libraries** :

**random** : To generate random choices.

**string**: To access a set of characters (letters, digits, punctuation).

define or create a function **generate_password** with parameter of password criteria including length , uppercase, lowercase, etc.

**Function generate_password(length, include_uppercase, include_digits, include_punctuation):**

* Defines character sets for lowercase, uppercase, digits, and punctuation.

* Combines selected character sets based on user preferences.

* Ensures the password includes at least one character from each selected category.

* Fills the rest of the password length with random choices from the combined character set.

* Shuffles the password list to ensure randomness.

* Converts the list to a string and returns it.

Now create the **Main section ** of the  Program :

* Prompts the user to enter the desired password length and preferences for including uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation.

* Calls the generate_password function with the specified parameters.

* Prints the generated password.
